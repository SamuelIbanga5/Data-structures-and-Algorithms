# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures
Data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. Data structures are not only used for organizing the data. They are also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

### Linked Lists
Linked list is a data structure that includes series of connected nodes where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
#### Singly Linked Lists
In this linked list, each node of the linked list points to the next node.
#### Doubly Linked Lists
In this linked list, each of the node holds two pointers, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node.
